INTRODUCTION Whereashomo economicuspurchases products on the basis of an evaluation of costs and bene®ts, most people are much less rational in their purchase behaviour. As has now long been acknowledged in the consumer behaviour literature, consumers' purchase behaviour seldom follows the principles of economic theory. Rather, consumers' purchases often seem to be desire, mood, or emotion driven, which thus seems naturaland the defaul t state of affairs (._see e.g. Etzioni, 1986).

Impulse buying can take extreme forms (._see e.g. Dittmar and Drury, 2000), and may even become pathological (._see e.g. O'Guinn and Faber, 1989). Impulse buying includes at least two core elements. The ®rst is the lack of planning and deliberation concerning the purchase of the impulsively bought product. However, purchases might be unplanned or not be deliberated for various reasons, for instance when a seemingly unplanned purchase had been planned longer before, or in the case of repeated or habitualpurchases (._Verpl anken and Aarts, 1999). In order for a purchase to qualify as an impulse purchase it should include a second element, namely an emotional response (._e.g. Beatty and Ferrell, 1998; Rook, 1987; Rook and Gardner, 1993; Wood, 1998).

Such emotional responses might be elicited prior to, simultaneously with, or after an unplanned purchase. The most salient emotions, which usually accompany impulse purchases, are pleasure and excitement. But there may also be a sudden and immediate felt urge to buy prior to an impulse purchase, which might be considered as a mild form of compulsion. Regret might be experienced afterwards, for instance concerning the unnecessarily spent money (._Dittmar and Drury, 2000). As the lack of planning and the dominance of emotions thus characterize impulse purchases, such behaviour seems dif®cult to model by traditional attitude and attitude-to- behaviour models, such as the theory of reasoned action (._Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980). In these models attitudes are predominantly viewed as cognition-based structures, which are derived from a consideration of costs and bene®ts.

Another perspective, one that seems more appropriate in the context of impulse buying, is that attitudes may be based on qualitatively different elements, i.e. cognitions on the one hand (._e.g. beliefs about costs and bene®ts) and emotions on the other hand (._e.g. feelings of excitement, fear, or pleasure). Each component may have an evaluative loading, which may be in line with each other, but may also be discrepant, such as the familiar `heart-versus-mind' problems (._see e.g. Ajzen, 2001; Breckler, 1984; Breckler and Wiggins, 1989; Crites, Fabrigar and Petty, 1994; Edwards, 1990; Verplanken, Hofstee and Janssen, 1998; Zanna and Rempel, 1988).

Such motives might be elicited by positive or negative events in one's personal life (._e.g. passing or failing an exam). More structural motives might also drive impulse buying.

Although the facets are clearly different, and were apparent in the factor structures, they were relatively strongly correlated.

The lack of planning and making elaborate evaluations in the area of purchasing products, which characterizes the impulse buyer, thus seems to be part of a similar general personality-based tendency that will be apparent in other domains as well.

The cognitive and affective facets were both associated with extraversion. While these patterns provided strong evidence for the construct validity of the impulse buying tendency scale, the ®ndings may also have important implications for our understanding of the phenomenon of impulse buying. The studies thus suggested that impulse buying tendency is anchored in fundamental personality characteristics. Impulse purchases thus seem to represent one of many behaviouraldomains in which more general personality traits are revealed. The relations of impulse buying tendency to the personality variables might also reveal some hints as to functionalaspects of impul se buying. Take, for instance, the positive relationship between impulse buying tendency and extraversion. Typical impulse buyers might use the purchase of products or certain types of product as means to express themselves, or express a group identity (._Dittmaret al., 1995, 1996; Dittmar and Drury, 2000).

For instance, certain products might symbolize a particular group one feels belonging to or to which one desires to belong, such as, for example, the `young woman', the `business man', or the `cool teenager' (._cf. Wicklund and Gollwitzer, 1982). Another example of how our results may shed some light on functional aspects of impulse buying might be the positive relationship between affective aspects of impulse buying tendency and action orientation. Action orientation is particularly related to affective self-regulatory mechanisms. Impulse purchases might thus be a way to channel or deal with emotions. This may occur in the context of positive emotions, in which case an impulse purchase might function as a way to reward oneself, or negative emotions, when impulse purchases might function as a way to comfort oneself.

Impulse buying might thus seem `non- rational'; it certainly need not be not functional. Impulse buying is typically a domain where gender differences seem apparent. The present study is no exception. The most reported ®ndings are that females tend to buy on impulse more frequently and buy different products on impulse than males (._see e.g. Dittmaret al., 1995, 1996; Wood, 1998). Our ®ndings were somewhat discrepant from what has been reported by others. In line with previous research, females showed a higher impulse buying tendency than males, but only in Study 1. In Study 2, in which the sample was more diverse in terms of age and educationalbackground and more bal anced in terms of gender, no signi®cant gender difference was found on impulse buying tendency.

In addition, the relationship between impulse buying tendency and self-reported purchases of impulse products seemed to be stronger among males than among females. It thus seems important to keep on focusing on gender differences in impulse buying, because these might also re¯ect more fundamental underlying processes, such as expressions of identity, as has been convincingly argued by Dittmar and colleagues (._1995, 1996; Dittmar and Drury, 2000). Clearly, impulse buying may take many forms, and may be manifested in a large variety of consumer environments. The present studies strongly suggested that the tendency to buy on impulse is rooted in personality. Future studies might further investigate in more detail the precise mechanisms that link personality to impulse buying and, more generally, to consumer behaviour.

The markets are diﬀerent and characterized by an increased co mpetition, as well a constant innovation in products and services available and a greater n umber of companies in the same market. In this scenario it is essential to know the consumer well (Varadarajan, 2020). It is through the analysis of the factors that have a direct impact on consumer behavior that it is possible to innovate and meet their expectations. This research is essen tial for marketers to be able to improve their campaigns and reach the target audience more eﬀectively (Ding et al., 2020 ).

Consumer behavior refers to the activities directly involv ed in obtaining products /services, so it includes the decision-making processes that precede and su cceed these actions. Thus, it appears that the advertising message can cause a certain psychologic al inﬂuence that motivates individuals to desire and, consequently, buy a certain product/service ( Wertenbroch et al., 2020 ). Studies developed by Meena (2018) show that from a young age one begins to have a preference for one product/service over another, as we are confronted wi th various commercial stimuli that shape our choices. The sales promotion has become one of the mos t powerful tools to change the perception of buyers and has a signiﬁcant impact on their purchas e decision ( Khan et al., 2019 ).

It is essential to understand the ment al triggers behind the purchase decision process, which is why consumer psychology is related to market ing strategies ( Ding et al., 2020 ).

Consumers are attract ed by advertising and the messages it conveys, which is reﬂected in their behavior and purchase int entions (Varadarajan, 2020). Impulse buying has been studied from several perspectives, nam ely: (i) rational processes; (ii) emotional resources; (iii) the cognitive currents arising from the theory of social judgment; (iv) persuasive communication; (v) and the eﬀects of advertising o n consumer behavior ( Malter et al., 2020). The causes of impulsive behavior are triggered by an irresistib le force to buy and an inability to evaluate its consequences. Despite being aware of the nega tive eﬀects of buying, there is an enormous desire to immediately satisfy your most pressing nee ds (Meena, 2018).

Factors Affecting Impulse Buying Behavior of Consumers that a considerable percentage of sales comes from purchases t hat are not planned and do not correspond to the intended products before entering the store. According to Burton et al. (2018) , impulse purchases occur when there is a sudden and strong emotional desire, which ari ses from a reactive behavior that is characterized by low cognit ive control. This tendency to buy spontaneously and without reﬂection can be explained by the immediate gratiﬁcation it provides to the buyer ( Pradhan et al., 2018 ). Impulsive shopping in addition to having an emotional content can be triggered by several factors, including: the store environment, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and the emot ional state of the consumer at that time ( Gogoi and Shillong, 2020 ).

The sensory and psychological factors associated with the type of products, the knowledge about them and brand loyalty, often end up overlapping the importance attributed to the physical environment ( Platania et al., 2016 ). The impulse buying causes an emotional lack of control generated by the conﬂict between the immediate reward and th e negative consequences that the purchase can originate, whic h can trigger compulsive behaviors that can become chronic and pathological ( Pandya and Pandya, 2020 ).

Sohn and Ko (2021) , argue that although all impulse purchases can be considered as unplanned, not all unplanned purchases can be considered impulsive. Unplanned purchases can occur, simply because the consumer needs to purchase a product, but for whatever reason has not been placed on the shopping list in advance. This suggests that unplanned purchases are not necessarily accompanied by the urgent desire that generally characterizes impulse purchases. The impulse purchases arise from sensory experiences (e.g., store atmosphere, product layout), so purchases made in physical stores tend to be more impulsive than purchases made online. This type of shopping results from the stimulation of the ﬁve senses and the internet does not have this capacity, so that on line shopping can be less encouraging of impulse purchases than shopping in physical stores ( Moreira et al., 2017 ).

Researches developed by Aragoncillo and Orús (2018) reveal that 40.0% of consumers spend more money than planned, in physical stores compared to 25.0% in online purchases. This situation can be explained by the fact that consumers must wait for the product to be delivered when they buy online and this time interval may make impulse purchases unfeasible. Following the logic of Platania et al. (2017) we consider that impulse buying takes socially accepted behavior to the extreme, which makes it diﬃcult to distinguish between normal consumption and pathological consumption.

The nature of compulsive buying The technical term for compulsive buying disorder is onioma- nia, derived from the Greek wordsonios meaning “for sale” and mania meaning “insanity.” The root words of the term may imply that compulsive buyers’ crazed addiction may be triggered and moderated by sales promotions.

Neurological research reveals that the brain activity in de- cision-making regions differs signiﬁcantly between compulsive and non-compulsive buyers (Raab et al., 2011), which could pos- sibly provide an explanation for why compulsive buyers lose control and fall into addiction. In the United States, the prevalence of compulsive buying behavior among consumers is estimated to be 5.8%, the vast majority of whom, roughly 80%, are female (Koran et al., 2006).

Over the next two decades, consumer researchers conducted numerous empiri- cal studies using these two compulsive buying scales, including several on psychiatric patients with compulsive habits (Chang et al., 2011; Cole and Sherrell, 1995; Johnson and Attmann, 2009; Lejoyeux et al., 1997; Palan et al., 2011; Cherrier and Ponnor, 2010; Roberts, 1998; Tett et al., 2013).

That said, relatively less is known about how consumer impulses drive compulsiveness ( Ozer and Gultekin, 2015). 1.2. Impulse vs. compulsive buying Impulse and compulsive buying are two nonstandard buying behaviors that are frequently discussed in tandem. However, compulsive buying is not synonymous and should not be confused with impulse buying. It is important to make a clear distinction between addictive, uncontrollable buying (compulsive) and spontaneous, unplanned buying impulses.Rook (1987)asserts: “Impulse buying occurs when a consumer experiences a sud- den, often powerful and persistent urge to buy something im- mediately. The impulse to buy is hedonically complex and may stimulate emotional conﬂict.

More concisely, impulsive buying describes the tendency to make unplanned and unreﬂective purchases (Jones et al., 2003). Impulse buying is a much more wide spread phenomenon than compulsive buying, with many consumers exhibiting this type of behavior at some point in purchase encounters. There are two conceptual views that are often employed to explain the relationship or differences between compulsive and impulsive buying. The ﬁrst of these perspectives contends that consumers are positioned along a continuum of‘urgency to buy’, and those in the upper extreme are compulsive buyers (d’Astous, 1990). Thus, impulse buyers and compulsive buyers lie on different ends of a spectrum, where compulsive buying represents an ex- treme urge to buy.

This‘urge to buy continuum’conceptualization raises some interesting questions. In particular, could repeated impulses and unplanned purchases be an early sign, or trigger for compulsive buying behavior? An alternative conceptualization focuses on the underlying emotional factors that contribute to compulsive behaviors (Faber and Christenson, 1996). Positive affect refers to the entire spec- trum of pleasurable feelings or emotions such as happiness, en- joyment, excitement, enthusiasm, energy, and satisfaction. Nega- tive affect, on the other hand, includes the whole range of un- pleasant mood emotions such as depression, anger, nervousness, stressfulness, anxiety, and fear (Watson et al., 1988).

Their research suggests that positive affect is associated with the ten- dency to buy impulsively, while negative affect is associated with inherently compulsive buying tendencies ( Flight et al., 2012 ). However, research ﬁndings on these issues in marketing and psychology literature have been largely inconsistent. For example, research has also linked impulse buying to consumers’ negative affect (Silvera et al., 2008; Verplanken et al., 2005).

Furthermore, these authors state that“the differ- ence between compulsive buying and impulse buying is somehow the whole cognitive process which leads a person to associate a prompt readjustment of his affective disequilibrium to the buying act, and this, through his or her cognitive associations” (p. 420). Essentially, the level of self-control for compulsive buyers is very low to nonexistent, while the level of self-control for impulse buyers is relatively higher.Hoch and Loewenstein (1991)provide an excellent conceptualization of consumer self-control and ex- plain it as a conﬂict between two opposing", "num_tokens": 207, "source": "papers/how impulse buying influence.pdf", "hash": "fe9058d0fba6c6a1149b6c694be717ce"}

Theoretical background Research suggests that compulsive consumers share a tendency to fantasize, higher depression rates, materialistic orientations, and higher levels of anxiety and obsession compared to other consumers (d’Astous, 1990; Faber and O’Guinn, 1992; Müller et al., 2011). Compulsive buyers may employ obsessive buying behaviors to cope with and alleviate their undesirable, negative mood states (Faber and Christenson, 1996; Müller et al., 2012). Before engaging in compulsive buying, respondents reported feelings of high ne- gative affect and low positive affect.

Therefore, problem resolution is not a determining factor in the assessment of whether or not a certain behavior can be considered a coping strategy since consumers may evaluate the outcome of a situation as satisfactory as long as perceived stress was managed to the best of his/her ability.

Speciﬁcally, escape theory posits that self- awareness of a problem may be so painful that consumers partake in immediate, speciﬁc and self-destructive tasks like compulsive buying or binge eating as a means of escape (Yi, 2012). Compulsive buyers employ cognitive narrowing by focusing their attention solely on the buying task, thus temporarily blocking out their anxieties. Due to their narrow attention during a buying episode, compulsive buyers fail to consider the long-term, negative con- sequences of their actions. Instead, they experience short-term improvements in mood which reinforces their behaviors and drives recurring acts of compulsion (O’Guinn and Faber, 1989).

Impulse buying Consumer researchers have long considered impulse buying a distinct aspect of American consumers’ lifestyles and shopping habits (Rook, 1987). As described earlier, impulses occur sponta- neously and without cognition driving consumers to purchase in ways that conﬂict with self-interests. Inductive reasoning suggests that compulsive buying is likely the outcome of a progression and succession of impulsive buying behaviors. In support,Faber (2004) argues that compulsive buying behavior should be classiﬁed as a type of impulse control disorder. Consumer impulses may be triggered by a variety of factors. For instance, changes in consumer mood or situational aspects of the store environment have been shown to inﬂuence impulse pur- chasing (Ozer and Gultekin, 2015).

In a similar vein, we argue that losing control in purchase situations elicits negative emotions and apprehension in consumers. Formally: H1. Impulse buying relates positively to consumer anxiety.

Also, as people who “escape” may be in a more positive mood or frame of mind because they are moving away from their anxieties, they may also be more likely to ritualize their escape through compulsive buying. Meta- analytic evidence suggests that positive mood is positively related to compulsive consumption in adults (Cardi et al., 2015).

Perhaps the most noteworthy result is that consumer escapism buffers the conversion of anxiety into compulsive buying. Whereas some consumers resort to destructive behaviors such as compul- sive buying to alleviate stress, others imagine their anxieties away through fantasizing and engage in less compulsive buying as a result. Essentially, these consumers cope with negative emotions and apprehension through their imagination and avoid the trap of addictive buying (see coping theory).

Third, the employed scale used to capture escapism (O’Guinn and Faber, 1989) is not context speciﬁc to shopping which may have inﬂu- enced the relationship between escapism and compulsive buying. Individual responses may have been different by adapting scale items to more appropriately ﬁt this research. For example, “I daydream a lot” could have read “I daydream a lot when I go shopping”.

Fourth, Zung's (1971)self-rating anxiety scale is used to mea- sure anxiety. Affect and emotion scales typically consist of one- word items, e.g. I-PANAS-SF (Thompson, 2007). Anxiety items from I-PANAS-SF consist of afraid, upset, nervous, ashamed, and hostile. Two of the items employed from Zung's anxiety scale each contained one of these anxiety items, i.e.“I feel afraid for no reason at all” and “I get upset easily or feel panicky.” The remaining anxiety scale item,“I feel like I’m falling apart and going to pieces”, is com- parable to another one-word item,nervous. 5.

Thus far, progress in compulsive buying research has led to the identiﬁcation of numerous antecedents and out- comes of compulsive buying. However, behavioral remedies for compulsive buying are lacking signiﬁcantly. Research should focus on practical ways to enhance consumer resistance to buying im- pulses. For instance, this research indicates that consumers who are inclined to buy compulsively should abstain from tempting buying situations (i.e. visiting e-commerce sites or store locations without a clear need), especially when feeling down or stressed.

However, several researchers have noted that price is a complex stimulus and many consumers perceive price more broadly than strictly in its \"negative role\" as an outlay of economic resources. For example, numerous studies have provided evidence that many consumers use the price cue as a signal to indicate product quality.

Erickson and Johansson (1985) modeled the dual role of the price cue within a single study and found that price-level percep­ tions had a direct negative effect on purchase intentions and an indirect positive effect on purchase intentions via product quality perceptions. Our premise is that if the price cue is indeed a com­ plex stimulus, finer discriminations in consumer percep­ tions of both the positive and negative roles of price ap­ pear plausible.

Perception of the price cue for some consumers can be characterized more narrowly as reflecting price consciousness. Though the term \"price consciousness\" has been used by different researchers to refer to a variety of price-related cognitions (cf. Zei­ thaml 1984), we use the term in a very narrow sense to refer to the degree to which the consumer focuses ex­ clusively on paying low prices.

Coupon proneness. Perception of the price cue in its negative role may also be related to the form in which the price cue is presented. Consistent with this perspec­ tive, several researchers have argued that a price reduc­ tion in coupon form may produce an increase in con­ sumer response beyond that which would result from an equivalent lower noncoupon price (cf. Lichtenstein, Ne­ temeyer, and Burton 1990). Cotton and Babb (1978) and Schindler (1990) found empirical support for this notion. These findings imply that the increase in sales resulting from a price offered in coupon form over the increase that would result from an equivalent lower noncoupon price seemingly must be due to an increased sensitivity to price in its negative role when it is offered in coupon form.

A rationale very similar to that for coupon proneness suggests that for some consumers, an increased sensitivity to price in its negative role is related to the price being in sale form, that is, a discount from the regular selling price (e.g., \"regular price $1.99, sale price $1.29\").

Positive Role of Price Price-quality schema. For some consumers, the price cue may be perceived in a positive role because of an inference that the level of the price cue is related posi­ tively to the level of product quality (cf. Erickson and Johansson 1985). To the degree consumers perceive price in this way, they view higher prices more favorably be­ cause of perceptions of increases in product quality for additional monetary outlays (cf. Lichtenstein, Bloch, and Black 1988). In fact, because consumers who perceive price in this way actually prefer paying higher prices, their behavior has been referred to as \"price seeking\" (Tellis and Gaeth 1990).

First, each of the seven scales was submit­ ted individually to a confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL VII and items with low standardized factor loadings were deleted (Joreskog and Sorbom 1989). The fit of each of the seven models (i.e., scales) was then assessed on four indices: the goodness-of-fit index (GFl), the adjusted-goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), the Tucker­ Lewis index (TLI), and Bentler's (1990) corrected fit in­ dex (CFI).

For example, Zeithaml (1982, p. 363) operationalized \"degree of semantic encoding\" with three items: \"I buy the lowest priced product in the product category,\" \"I make price comparisons between different forms of a product (canned vs. frozen green beans, for example),\" and \"I use unit pricing to compare the prices of prod­ ucts.\" Though all three scale items appear consistent with a perception of price in its negative", "num_tokens": 193, "source": "papers/Price_Perceptions_and_Consumer_Shopping.pdf", "hash": "5bc2f23c3fbad65ed3abf8f2cb616fcc"}

For price-quality schema and prestige sensitivity, our results appear interpretable in terms of attribution theory. Consistent with principles from per­ son perception, prestige sensitivity can be viewed as a consumer's propensity to make attributions about other consumers, or a consumer's propensity to be sensitive to attributions that other consumers may make about him or her, on the basis of the price level of purchases (cf. Calder and Burnkrant 1977). Consistent with principles from object perception, a price-quality schema can be viewed as the consumer's propensity to use price to make generalized attributions about product (object) quality. Thus, prestige sensitivity would be expected to be re­ lated to marketplace behaviors that are more socially vis­ ible, whereas price-quality schema would be expected to be less sensitive to the issue of social visibility but more sensitive to contextual cues that reinforce the perceived validity of using price to infer", "num_tokens": 189, "source": "papers/Price_Perceptions_and_Consumer_Shopping.pdf", "hash": "6703f4796b29989e393fa525754d6fce"}

Future research aimed at providing further insights into prestige sensitivity and price-quality schema should in­ vestigate these two constructs within more formal attri­ bution theory frameworks. By investigating consumer price-related attributions within theories that specifically account for the effects of theoretically based categories for contextual variables, researchers may gain insights into categories of contextual variables that affect con­ sumers' propensity to act on their level of prestige sen­ sitivity or price-quality schema.

These issues appear to be closely related to those of \"consensus\" specifically encompassed in many theories of attribution. Also, maybe the \"consistency\" with which a sale promotion is offered on a brand moderates the relationship between price­ quality schema and sale purchase behavior by affecting the attribution evoked to account for the sale (e.g., \"this brand is always on sale; it must not be a high quality one\"). Consistency of information is another variable in­ herent in many theories of attribution (cf. Mizerski, Golden, and Kernan 1979).

Again, investigation within an attribution theory framework may provide theoretical ex­ planations for contexts that moderate the saliency of dif­ ferent categories of cues (e.g., price vs. brand name) for use in making attributions about a target (e.g., brand).

The study assumes immense signiﬁcance because it not only presents useful insight regarding the behaviour of Indian consumers in an ever developing retail sector in India, but also considering the fact that this is theﬁrst time an attempt has been made to assess the simultaneous impact of theseﬁve intrinsic factors on impulsive buying behaviour. Importantly, the ﬁndings also revealed that the inﬂuence of intrinsic variables on impulsive buying behaviour did not vary across gender. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1.

Introduction and background After the sustained love affair of researchers in deﬁning and redeﬁning impulsive buying behaviour (Bellenger et al., 1978; Kollat and Willet, 1967; Stern, 1962), the focus gradually shifted from the ‘what’ of impulsive buying to the‘why’ and then to the‘how’ of it. From taxonomical to cognitive (Hoch and Loewenstein, 1991; Rook and Fisher, 1995)a n dﬁnally somewhat to trait oriented approach (Bratko et al., 2013), the impulsive buying literature has been witnessing both horizontal as well as vertical surge. Needless to point out, that on one hand, there have been a plethora of studies across the globe trying to assess the impact of situational ( Belk, 1975; Chavosh et al., 2011; Foroughi et al., 2012)a n dm a r k e t i n gd r i v e n factors (Stern, 1962; Karbasivar and Yarahmadi, 2011; Lifu, 2012; Mehta and Chugan, 2013); while on the other hand, new theoretical models and frameworks have continuously been developed.", "num_tokens": 282, "source": "papers/Intrinsic_factors_affecting_impulsive_bu.pdf", "hash": "bff14f291af4c73324fe74ec51f0cf53"}

How- ever, still huge gaps exist with respect to developing understanding related to psychological aspects of the phenomenon, and one such literature gap is the overlooking of simultaneous impact of intrinsic factors on impulsive buying behaviour. Though one may argue that internal factors such as consumer characteristics related to impulsive buying have been a subject of many studies (e.g. Chavosh et al., 2011), however, in almost none of those studies the cumulative impact of intrinsic factors like materialism and shopping enjoyment tendency has been consid- ered and studied in the same tune as personality traits, culture or even impulsive buying tendency.

This is partly because of the fact that apart from personality ( Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001; Herabadi et al., 2009) and cultural constructs (Kacen and Lee, 2002; Jalees, 2009) and even the impulsive buying tendency construct (Chavosh et al., 2011; Foroughi et al., 2013;Rook and Gardner, 1993), not many researchers have looked at the inherent side of either shopping enjoyment tendency or materialism.

Personality and impulsive buying behaviour According toSchiffman (2008), personality is unique and dynamic organization of characteristics of a particular person– physical and psychological – which inﬂuences behaviour and responses to the social and physical environment. In other words, it is a set of psychological traits and mechanisms within the individual that are organised and relatively enduring ( Larsen and Buss, 2010).

Although the initial attempts tounderstand and predict consumer behaviour through the use of personality variables yielded disappoint- ing results ( Kassarjian, 1971), there has recently been a growing interest in personality inﬂuences in consumer research (e.g.,Egan and Taylor, 2010; Lin, 2010a, 2010b; Ranjbarian and Kia, 2010).

Personality trait‘extraversion’ and impulsive buying behaviour Individuals high on the trait‘extraversion’ have an energetic approach to the social and material world and are social, active and have a tendency to experience positive emotions ( John and Srivastava, 1999; McCrae and Costa, 2008). This sociability means they are more likely to come in contact with sales people, and given the risk-taking propensity being consistent with the extra- vert disposition toward excitement-seeking and uncertainty pre- ference ( Chen, 2011), the chances of extraverts indulging in impulsive buying is likely to be more as compared to those low of this trait.

Further, it has been reported (Hirsh, 2010) that people with dominant personality trait of openness are curious about new experiences and products, and are expected to adopt new products more quickly than people who are less open to experience. Thus, people with relatively high scores on this trait are consid- ered to have broad interests and are more likely to seek out new experiences, while those low on this trait are considered to be practical and traditional ( McCrae and Costa, 2008 ). Therefore, considering the intellectual curiosity associated with this trait ( McCrae and Costa, 2008), in our view, such individuals are likely to be more impulsive. Hence, impulsive buying behaviour is expected to correlate positively with this personality trait, and therefore, it is being proposed that, H1E.

One reason for the signiﬁcant relationship between collectivists and impulsive buying behaviour, as pointed out by Dameyasani and Abraham (2013)could be attributed to the fact that impulsive buying correlated with a desire to satisfy social needs ( Hausman, 2000) which meant that presence of group member(s) was likely to increase the chances of collectivists ’ indulging in impulsive purchasing.

This deﬁnition highlights the rather undermined fact that shop- ping enjoyment tendency could possibly be referred as a speciﬁc internal enduring tendency of the individual to enjoy the shopping process. The fact that for some individuals enjoyment comes from shopping process intrinsically within themselves due to their shopping activity ( Jung and Lim, 2006; Bong Soeseno, 2010), it would be worthwhile to consider it an important intrinsic factor.

Materialism and impulsive buying behaviour Beginning with the seminal work of Belk (1984)in deﬁning and explaining materialism as an intrinsic trait, many perspectives have developed to explain this important construct. While Csikszentmihalyi (2004) considered it as an attitude towards material goods,Kasser et al. (2007) looked at it from value orientation perspective. Interestingly, both in the broader perspective of consumer behaviour ( Zarco, 2014; Garðarsdóttir and Dittmar, 2012; A.J. Badgaiyan, A.

It has been stated (Steven and Srinivas (2013); Dittmar and Bond, 2010) that materialism describes consumers who attach value to material objects and ﬁnd meaning and identity in possessions, and hence, these individuals were driven by the beliefs that the accumulation of consumer goods was a central life goal and a key to happiness. This naturally means that when materialists come across purchase decisions regarding a product or service that they think might win admiration or status for them, they usually fail to resist the temptation to buy ( Wu, 2006).

Interestingly, for such consumers, wealth was an indicator of social status, achievement, and reputation ( Liao and Wang, 2009) and they did not hesitate to even purchase expensive products of famous brands (Bae, 2013; Prendergast and Wong, 2003).

(2006) demonstrated that highly materialistic people had higher impulsive buying tendencies, several other studies too (Hourigan and Bougoure, 2012; Park et al., 2006; Mowen, 2000) indicated signiﬁcant positive relationship between materialism and impul- sive buying.

Impulsive buying tendency and impulsive buying behaviour Impulsive buying tendency conceptualised by Rook and Fisher (1995) as a consumer trait is deﬁned as “the degree to which an individual is likely to make unintended, immediate, and unreﬂective purchases” ( Foroughi et al., 2013; Flight et al., 2012; Chen, 2008). Considered as a manifestation of general impulsive- ness (Siorowska, 2011; Dholakia, 2000; Punj, 2011; Sharma et al., 2010), impulsive buying tendency has also been deﬁned as an automatic response to novel stimuli that occurred at a precon- scious level due to biological tendencies (Sharma et al., 2010). It has been suggested that consumers with high impulsive buying tendency tended to indulge more in impulsive buying on account of the fact that people high on impulsive buying tendency experienced more lack of control compared to the customers that had relatively lower impulsive buying tendency (Foroughi et", "num_tokens": 244, "source": "papers/Intrinsic_factors_affecting_impulsive_bu.pdf", "hash": "054bfc682a900af22868388e4b8f2370"}

In same context, another reason for people high on impulsive buying tendency indulging in impulsive behaviour has been attributed to the unreﬂective thinking associated with this trait which is considered to be driven by desire for immediate gratiﬁca- tion ( Siorowska, 2011). Importantly, with results indicating that consumers high on impulsive buying tendency were more prone to buy on impulse than their counterparts with low impulsive buying tendency ( Foroughi et al., 2013; Herabadi et al., 2009), this relatively stable individual difference variable (Herabadi et al., 2009; Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001) has become an important part of studies related to impulsive buying behaviour.

Common method variance Common method variance is a form of systematic error variance capable of affecting the estimates of the true relationship among theoretical constructs by posing problems in questionnaire-based studies especially with regard to possible adverse impact on the relevance of Cronbach alpha scores ( Gorrell et al., 2011). Thus, common method variance tests are recommended to identify the possibility of such biases with a view to treat the effect in case it did impact the study. For this study, ﬁrst the diagnostic ‘Harman’s one-factor’ test was used to identify the possible presence of errors due to common method.

With clarity regarding the impact of intrinsic factors on impul- sive buying behaviour, it becomes imperative to assess if this impact could be generalised for the entire population or was there an element of variation with regard to the basic gender distinction. In past, there have been ﬁndings reporting that impulsive behaviour did vary with gender ( Lin and Lin, 2005; Ghani et al., 2011; Lifu, 2012 ). Some authors attributed this difference to genetic basis of risk aversion (as cited byTifferet and Herstein, 2012, based onMiles et al., 2001), while some other (Kempf et al., 2006) considered it to the inherent difference in processing communication messages.

To study gender-wise variation in the effect of intrinsic factors on impulsive buying behaviour, multiple-group conﬁrmatory ana- lysis (MGCFA) using AMOS 20 software was used. In this analysis, ﬁrst, measurement invariance was tested because analysis results such as means or factor loadings can only be compared across different groups if the measures used have the same meanings in all the relevant groups ( Davidov, 2008). The relevance of measurement invariance can easily be gauged through the words of Chen (2008): “Measurement invariance is the equivalence of a measured construct in two or more groups, such as people from different cultures. It assures that the same constructs are being assessed in each group”.

Interestingly, as obvious from the path coefﬁcients mentioned in the table, in the male group, relationship between Extraversion—IBB, and Conscientiousness— IBB is seen to be signiﬁcant though it appears to be insigniﬁcant for the female group. However, a closer look at the table’s last column suggests that difference between path coefﬁcients for the mentioned paths is not signiﬁcant between the two groups. This means that as the sample size will increase, the results will tend to resemble the path relationships as visible in the combined data.

Thus, it is amply clear that gender does not moderate the relationships between intrinsic variables and impulsive buying behaviour. 5. Results and discussion Considering the fact that for theﬁrst time the mentionedﬁve intrinsic factors have been simultaneously examined for their possible impact on impulsive buying, the study makes useful contribution. Importantly, the veryﬁrst ﬁnding of the study related to signi- ﬁcant association of two personality constructs with impulsive buying behaviour conﬁrms the utility of the personality approach to comprehend consumer behaviour.

This means that outgoing and sociable people were more susceptible to impulsive buying and could be targeted by the sales people. Thus, based on this ﬁnding, on one hand, marketers in general, and retailers in particular, should look for speciﬁc indica- tors to identify people high on extraversion so as to instigate impulsive behaviour, while on the other hand, people high on this trait should be more careful so as avoid the possibility of post-purchase dissonance.

These signi ﬁcant associations between personality constructs and impulsive buying behaviour further strengthen the optimism that impulsive buying could strongly be rooted in personality. Further, though too nascent to be generalised at this stage, the positive inﬂuence of the cultural-trait collectivism on impulsive behaviour – in stark contrast to the earlier assumption that eastern collectivist societies were conservative spenders ( Kacen and Lee, 2002; Gutierrez, 2004 ) – in a way indicates the change in purchasing prowess of the eastern societies. Though much more in-depth and large scale study needs to validate this seemingly over optimistic presumption, however, the evidence from similar studies in Pakistan ( Jalees, 2009) and Indonesia ( Dameyasani and Abraham, 2013)d eﬁnitely presents a point in the case.

The authors feel that this positive association between collectivism and impulsive buying could be on account of three factors. First, with opening up of economy coupled with rapidly developing mall culture, this could be indicator of shift in trend from‘shopping for need’ to ‘shopping for fun’, and even at times reaching the level of ‘shopping for greed’. Thus, the likelihood is that the hitherto seemingly conservative collectivists mightﬁnally have begun to loosen the purse by going for impulsive buying. Second, as pointed out by Dameyasani and Abraham (2013), with increased trend of group shopping, the chances are that collectivists are being affected by the presence of others and they might be inﬂuenced to buy impulsively.

Also, the positive relationship (beta ¼.673, p¼***) between impulsive buying tendency and impulsive buying behaviour was on expected lines. This was in line withﬁndings of Rook and Fisher (1995) who mentioned that consumers high on the impulsivity trait usually bought more frequently on impulse more than others.

Though, many studies in the past have indicated that in comparison to men, women had higher levels of impulsive buying ( Lin and Lin, 2005; Ghani et al., 2011), our ﬁndings indicate that no difference was visible in relation to the inﬂuence of intrinsic factors on impulsive buying behaviour.

Overall, results show the relevance of allﬁve intrinsic factors in explaining impulsive buying behaviour, and on one hand, these results corroborateﬁndings from some past studies, while on the other hand, leave scope for validation of the current study through related future endeavours. 6.

CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND Trait Aspects of Buying Impulsiveness The general trait of impulsiveness, or impulsivity (the terms are used interchangeably), has been studied ex- tensively by clinical and developmental psychologists, education researchers, and criminologists (e.g., Eysenck et al. 1985; Hilgard 1962). Presently, over a dozen psy- chological measures of general impulsiveness exist (see Gerbing, Ahadi, and Patton [1987] for a review), yet there is no current theory-driven and validated measure of buying impulsiveness.

This finding, accompanied by psy- chologists' enduring treatment of impulsiveness as a basic human trait, encourages our belief that individ- uals' impulse buying tendencies can be conceptualized as a consumer trait that we label buying impulsiveness. We hypothesize that buying impulsiveness is a uni- dimensional construct that embodies consumers' ten- dencies both to think and to act in identifiable and distinctive ways.

Highly impulsive buyers are more likely to experience spontaneous buying stimuli; their shopping lists are more \"open\" and receptive to sudden, unexpected buying ideas. Also, their thinking is likely to be relatively unreflective, prompted by physical proximity to a de- sired product, dominated by emotional attraction to it, and absorbed by the promise of immediate gratification (Hoch and Loewenstein 1991; Thompson, Locander, and Pollio 1990). As a result, impulsive buyers are more likely to act on whim and to respond affirmatively and immediately to their buying impulses. In extreme cases, impulsive behavior is almost entirely stimulus driven; a buying impulse translates directly into an immediate, yielding, and physical response, or as Levy (1987) de- scribes it, a consumer \"spasm.\" Moreover, impulsive buyers are likely to experience buying impulses more frequently and strongly than other consumers.

Factors such as a consumer's economic position, time pressure, social visibility, and perhaps even the buying impulse itself can trigger the need to evaluate a prospective impulsive purchase quickly (cf.

Normative Evaluations of Buying Impulsiveness We define normative evaluations as consumers' judgments about the appropriateness of making an im- pulsive purchase in a particular buying situation. After selectively reviewing the relevant literature in clinical and developmental psychology, economics, criminol- ogy, and consumer research, we sought to identify the normative dimensions that seem most likely to influ- ence consumers' impulse buying behaviors. One central aspect derives from clinical psychologists' distinctions between rational and impulsive behavior. According to Freud and his later interpreters, two basic human thought processes, primary and secondary, differ in the degree to which they encourage impulsive behavior (Freud 1911; Hilgard 1962).

While secondary thought processes tend toward the rational and socialized, pri- mary mental processes pull in the opposite direction and encourage uninhibited, impulsive behavior that is likely viewed as irrational. Some developmental psychologists elaborate on this thinking by associating impulsive with immature be- havior. Because primary mental processes generate im- pulses that demand immediate gratification of basic, presocialized needs (e.g., a toddler's candy tantrum), impulsive buying behavior among adults is likely to be evaluated as immature and self-centered. Much eco- nomic analysis agrees with this perspective, but em- phasizes the fiscal improvidence of impulsive spending.

This perspective f'requently leads to evaluations of impulse buying as shortsighted and wasteful. Finally, both the clinical and consumer literatures draw attention to linkages between impulsive acts and negative outcomes. When individuals act on impulse, they tend to do so quickly and nonreflectively, which increases the likelihood of unintended and undesirable outcomes such as unwed adolescent pregnancy (Jones and Philliber 1983), drug and alcohol addiction (Ainslie 1975; Hirschman 1992), eating disorders (Steiger, Leung, and Piientes 1992), and criminal delinquency (Eysenck and McGurk 1980).

To some ex- tent, negative views about impulsive behavior derive from interests in exceptional cases that involve signif- icant departures from existing social behavior norms. However, the motives for and consequences of impulse buying for many individuals are less problematic. And much impulse buying arguably involves only minor in- fractions of relevant norms.

This emphasis on the situational dimension is critical because even if consumers have generalized normative views about impulse buying, the most consequential influences are likely those that emerge when a consumer experiences a buying impulse in a particular situation. Moreover, different impulse buying situations tend to evoke varying normative evaluations. For example, impulse buying may be viewed as a socially acceptable way to spend $50 in lottery winnings, but as a bad way to dispose of one's rent money. Even the most impulsive buyer probably will resist making an impulsive purchase that would cause him or her to be labeled as foolish, crazy, wasteful, or immature.

Another reason for using subgroup analysis is our hy- pothesis that the effect of consumers' impulse buying norms as a trait-behavior moderator is not likely a con- tinuous one. By nature, normative evaluations tend to be dichotomous, and their behavioral influence often communicates either a summary yes or no to some an- ticipated action. In the context of impulse buying, this idea suggests that normative influences operate as a be- havioral \"gate\" that is either open or closed, with little or no middle ground.

The lack of a significant association between the trait and behavior in the unfavorable norm group is also as hypothesized, but the reasons for this finding appear more complex. Individuals who have low impulsive tendencies and who also judge a possible im- pulse purchase negatively are unlikely to act on their buying impulses in such situations. However, when more impulsive consumers view a purchase as bad, they are likely to feel varying degrees of ambivalence. These individuals feel almost simultaneously an arousing and spontaneous impetus to buy and a strong normative warning against acting on impulse.

DISCUSSION Impulse buying behavior represents a long-standing puzzle for consumer and marketing researchers, and many efforts to conceptualize and measure it have been thwarted (Kollat and Willett 1969; Rook 1987). The results from the two studies reported here provide some insights into the social psychology that underlies the trait and behavioral aspects of impulsive buying be- havior. Although, as expected, we observed a general tendency for impulsive buyers to make more impulsive purchases, we found that normative evaluations mod- erate the relationship between this trait and subsequent buying behavior. Overall, our findings converge across student and in-store samples, classroom and retail set- tings, and both projected and actual shopping behaviors.

By including consumers' normative evaluations in the equation, we were able to gain clearer insights about the conditions under which the trait of buying impul- siveness would translate into actual impulsive buying behavior. We also gathered evidence about the possible threshold nature of normative effects. Even impulsive buyers seem able to reject making an impulsive pur- chase when negative normative evaluations reach some critical level. However, more research is needed to fully understand how, when, and to what extent normative evaluations actually occur. For example, we have as- sumed that the most salient normative evaluations oc- cur at the point of purchase, yet the present studies did not examine this.

Thus, future research might examine more broadly the social ecology in which these constructs interact. One interesting issue is how the social visibility of a prospective impulse purchase affects consumers' buying behavior (cf. Fisher and Price 1992). In theory, consumers will be less inclined to en- gage in impulse buying that is socially visible, either at the point of purchase or afterward. Analogously, im- pulsive purchases should materialize in contexts that provide relative social anonymity, such as in telemar- keting, internet, and direct mail ordering.

When a consumer is shopping alone, he or she may feel less socially visible, which should lower one's inhibitions about acting on impulse. The effects of shopping with others are probably more diverse and dependent on others' assigned or enacted social roles. Within consumers' social networks, other sources of influence include the social control mechanisms that translate general impulse buying norms into more spe- cific rules that define which product categories are per- missible, who may participate, how much can be spent, and what sanctions arise when rules are violated. A re- lated concern centers around what types of situations allow consumers to bend or break their impulse buying rules.

Who has not heard someone characterize a shopping episode with the confession: \"I was bad today?\" Sometimes con- sumers want to be bad. On the other hand, as we discussed earlier, impulse buying is not always normatively proscribed, as various situations may encourage it as practical, mature, ap- propriate, or merely as innocuous wickedness.

Diagnostic characteristics of CBSD include diminished control over buying/shopping (with regard to e.g., frequency, intensity, duration, and context), increasing priority given to buying/ shopping to the extent that the consumer activities interfere with other interests, leisure activities, professional duties, and daily responsibilities (Black, 2022; Laskowski, Trotzke, de Zwaan, Brand, & Müller, 2021; McElroy et al., 1994; Müller, Laskowski, Trotzke, et al., 2021), harmful conse- quences of inappropriate buying/shopping (e.g., clinically signiﬁcant distress, indebtedness, deceitful behavior, familial discord, shame, regret, embarrassment, or even legal", "num_tokens": 247, "source": "papers/2006-article-p631.pdf", "hash": "eb3cdc646d77eb27c48fdc1fb2a71585"}

Notwithstanding the numerous adverse consequences, the maladaptive consumer behavior is continued or even escalated. Treatment-seeking individuals with CBSD often suffer from other mental dis- orders, e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders, hoarding dis- order (i.e., accumulation of purchased items), eating disorders marked by binge eating, and other addictive be- haviors (Black, 2022; Christenson et al., 1994; Fernandez- Aranda et al., 2008; Granero et al., 2016; Müller et al., 2010).

With the growth of e-commerce, more and more people are buying/shopping on the internet, resulting in the shift from traditional offline CBSD to online CBSD (Adamczyk, 2021; Augsburger et al., 2020; Baggio et al., 2022; Duroy, Gorse, & Lejoyeux, 2014; Fineberg, Menchon, et al., 2022; Müller, Steins-Loeber, et al., 2019).

While the symptomatic pattern described above applies to both ofﬂine and online CBSD, it is not yet clear whether online CBSD should be seen as the virtual equivalent of traditional ofﬂine CBSD or, at least in a subgroup of individuals with online CBSD, as a standalone speciﬁc internet-use disorder that would not have developed in", "num_tokens": 277, "source": "papers/2006-article-p631.pdf", "hash": "128fe613816af60daca6ec1a46ade49c"}

It appears that online CBSD as compared to ofﬂine CBSD is associated with a higher severity of CBSD and in- terferes more with daily life, health, school, occupational, and social commitments due to time-consuming browsing for goods on the internet during night, school hours, working time, meetings or while one should be pursuing other daily obligations (Müller, Steins-Loeber, et al., 2019). In addition to speciﬁc internet and e-commerce features, individual expectancies and using motives may contribute to the development and maintenance of online CBSD, e.g., buying unobserved, avoiding analogue communication, getting access to huge product variety and anticipating the opportunity to satisfy an urge to buy promptly ( Kukar-", "num_tokens": 235, "source": "papers/2006-article-p631.pdf", "hash": "e4d566756b1ef8d35586e2f7fbaff9f1"}

Furthermore, reward and relief mechanisms known form substance use disorders and other behavioral addictions (e.g., gambling disorder) may play an important role in online CBSD as well (Brand, 2022; Brand, Young, Laier, Wölﬂing, & Potenza, 2016; Trotzke, Starcke, Müller, & Brand, 2019). The mention of CBSD in ICD-11 highlights its clinical relevance. Undoubtedly, treatment is necessary for CBSD, as the problem is associated with massive negative conse- quences for affected persons and their relatives, impairments in important areas of functioning, and chronicity (Achtziger et al., 2015; Benson, 2013; McElroy et al., 1994; Müller, Laskowski, Trotzke, et al., 2021; Park et al., 2006).

In view of the growth of e-commerce and the presumed increase in problematic or even addictive usage of shopping applica- tions (Augsburger et al., 2020; Müller, Steins-Loeber, et al., 2019), more attention should be paid to the speciﬁcs of online CBSD that may inﬂuence therapy. It is conceivable that successful treatment of online CBSD requires an adaptation of existing therapeutic approaches for CBSD. Past systematic reviews of treatments for CBSD concluded that cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) in the group format represents a helpful approach (Goslar, Leibetseder, Muench, Hofmann, & Laireiter, 2020; Hague, Hall, & Kellett, 2016; Leite, Pereira, Nardi, & Silva, 2014; Vasiliu, 2022), while no convincing effect was found for medication (Soares, Fernandes, & Morgado, 2016).

Previous systematic reviews have not paid attention to whether the CBSD occurred offline or online. In this work, we searched for treatment studies for CBSD that reported whether the buying/shopping environment (offline, online, mixed) was assessed and considered in the analyses. The aim was to provide a systematic update on treatment studies for online and/or offline CBSD with a focus on primary out- comes and the quality of reporting by using the Consoli- dated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria for treatment studies of the Cochrane Collaboration (Cumpston & Chandler, 2022; Moher et al., 2012). This review scope is of relevance for clinicians and researchers because additional information on the treatment of online CBSD will inform about the availability (or lack thereof) of new or adopted treatment approaches which may optimize clinical practice and initiate future proof-of-concept and treatment studies.

When we started this project, the last systematic reviews were published three (Goslar et al., 2020) to eight years ago (Leite, Pereira, et al., 2014). Our goal was in line with the recommendations for regular updates of systematic reviews of the Cochrane Collaboration ( Cumpston & Chandler, 2022; Moher et al., 2008). Recently, another systematic re- view was published byVasiliu (2022) that, however, differs from the current work with respect to methodological as- pects such as search strategy, included articles, analysis of primary outcomes and discussion. Therefore, the current work is justiﬁed and expands on previous reviews.

The rationale for the use of SSRIs was based on analogies between CBSD and obsessive-compulsive disor- ders (i.e., repetitive problematic behavior, preoccupation). It was assumed that enhancement of serotonergic neuro- transmission would decrease the extreme preoccupations with buying/shopping and the repetitive consumption ac- tivities (Black et al., 2000; Koran et al., 2002, 2003). With regard to memantine it was presumed that the medication would improve patients’ cognitive ﬂexibility and response inhibition by modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cortex, resulting in an improvement of CBSD (Grant et al., 2012). The anticonvulsant topiramate was used to facilitate neurotransmission ofγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to inhibit", "num_tokens": 263, "source": "papers/2006-article-p631.pdf", "hash": "1e30ad08d71e771aff4828904954e6af"}

The anticonvulsant topiramate was used to facilitate neurotransmission ofγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to inhibit glutamatergic activity, leading to reduced neural excitability and modulation of dopamine activity in the brain reward circuity (Nicoli de Mattos et al., 2020). Topiramate has a complex effect on both the GABAergic and glutamatergic system and may regulate the functioning of the nucleus accumbens in addictive processes (Nourre- dine et al., 2021). In the open medication studies the SSRI citalopram (Koran et al., 2002) or the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine (Grant et al., 2012) was administered over 10 or 12 weeks respectively. Two controlled medication studies investigated the SSRIﬂuvoxamine (Black et al., 2000; Ninan et al., 2000).

Two studies did not report CBS or YBOCS-SV means by group (Benson et al., 2014; Filomensky & Tavares, 2009) and, as mentioned above, one study used other outcome variables (Granero et al., 2017).

In contrast to Vasiliu ’s work, the present systematic review was preregistered, has a clear focus on original research (i.e. case reports, reviews and meta-ana- lyses were excluded) published between 2000 and December 2022, uses more comprehensive search terms, provides quantitative analyses of primary outcomes (effect sizes) and evaluates the quality of reporting of included studies based on CONSORT guideline (Moher et al., 2012).

In the following, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of included studies in detail and provide recommendations for further treatment research. None of the studies addressed online CBSD specifically. The preferred shopping environment was reported only in the very first CBT study, which was performed more than 17 years ago (Mitchell et al., 2006).

In psychotherapy research it is well known that the interpretation of effect sizes depend upon the choice of the control condition and that testing a treatment against waitlist is not a very strict approach ( Steinert, Stadter, Stark, & Leichsenring, 2017).

For all the criticism of the included CBT studies it should be taken into account that at least some of these studies (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2006) had a pilot character and can be viewed as pioneering work in the treatment of behavioral addic- tions.

Interestingly, no studies have been conducted with opioid antagonists (e.g., naltrexone, nalmefene) that inhibit dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and were beneficial in reducing urges to engage in addictive behaviors such as pathological gambling (Aboujaoude & Salame, 2016; Dowling et al., 2022; Piquet-Pessoa & Fontenelle, 2016).

In almost all studies, the YBOCS-SV (Monahan et al., 1996) and/or CBS (Faber & O’Guinn, 1992) were used. The overlap of in- struments across studies is a strength because it facilitates comparability of results, but the suitability of both in- struments as diagnostic tools or outcome measures is limited.

Cut-off scores for risk of CBSD are available for both the BSAS (Andreassen et al., 2015 ; Zarate, Fullwood, Proko ﬁeva, Grifﬁths, & Stavropoulos, 2022) and the PBS (Müller et al., 2015; Müller, Trotzke, et al., 2021), whereas only the PBS threshold for CBSD was validated in clinical samples (Fer- nandez-Aranda et al., 2019; Müller, Trotzke, et al., 2021). However, none of the currently available questionnaires for CBSD adequately represent the ICD-11 criteria for disorders due to addictive behaviors or impulse control disorders (WHO, 2022) and only the modiﬁed BSAS version for on- line shopping (Manchiraju et al., 2017 ) refers to online CBSD. There is a need for quantitative measures to assess symptom severity of CBSD. The requisite for valid assess- ment tools is the conceptualization of CBSD as formal diagnosis with accepted diagnostic criteria.

Limitations The present systematic review has some shortcomings. There is a potential risk of search biases given that studies published before 2000, non-English language manuscripts, grey literature and manuscripts that are not registered with PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science or PsycInfo were not considered. However, wide screening strings were used that were likely be over-inclusive. Additionally, manual search of related articles and reference lists was performed to reduce search biases.

While case reports were excluded, open-label trials were included even if only a few patients were treated. The quality of reporting was assessed using the CONSORT criteria for randomized controlled trials, which is not entirely appropriate for the RoB rating of open-label studies. This limited approach was used given the small number of controlled studies. It is also important to note that the RoB assessment refers to the study reports. Hence, missing re- ports in the publications do not necessary mean that these methods were not used in the respective study. Implications for future research Research on CBSD treatment would profit from more sys- tematic, high-quality methodology.

Complemen- tary computerized interventions to improve cognitive and affective processes relevant in addictive behaviors (e.g., cognitive bias modiﬁcation training) should be inves- tigated in relation to CBSD. Drug studies would beneﬁt from further insight into the neurobiology of CBSD. Last but not least, future studies should systematically assess and consider the preferred shopping environment (ofﬂine, on- line), speciﬁcs of online compared to ofﬂine buying/shop- ping activities, comorbid mental disorders (e.g., hoarding disorder, depression, other potential internet-use disorders) and personality proﬁles (e.g., high impulsivity or compul- sivity) when designing, conducting, and interpreting treat- ment studies.

Given the increasing importance of online shopping, research should address the question of whether the treat- ment of online CBSD differs from the treatment of tradi- tional CBSD and, if so, in what aspects exactly. Specific online CBSD-related interventions could focus on dealing with constant availability of shopping websites, online shopping cues (e.g, personalized advertisements, social me- dia influencer posts), technology design features, conver- gence of shopping platforms with other internet applications (e.g., social network sites) and relapse prevention (Flayelle et al., 2023 ; Müller, Joshi, & Thomas, 2022 ).

CONCLUSIONS To date, no treatment studies have been published specif- ically for online CBSD. The studies included in this sys- tematic review did not differentiate between a predominant offline and a predominant online CBSD subtype. While group CBT was effective in reducing the symptom severity of CBSD, the results should be interpreted with caution given the absence of appropriate control conditions and the lack of investigation of nonspecific compared to specific treatment effects and mechanisms of change.

More high-quality treatment research is needed in the field of CBSD with more emphasis on the CBSD subtype and mechanisms of change.

Research has increased substantially over the last 10 years, and the literature on this disorder has been reviewed in several publications (Black, 1996, 2001; Mueller, Reinecker, Jacobi, Reisch, & de Zwaan, 2005). Several case series have been published (Christenson, et al., 1994; McElroy, Keck, Pope, Smith, & Strakowski, 1994; Mitchell et al., 2002; Schlosser, Black, Repertinger, & Freet, 1994). These studies demonstrated that compulsive buying occurs primarily in women, with a usual age of onset between 18 and 30 years. The problem has been described both in North America and Europe (Scherhorn, Reisch, & Raab, 1990), and probably occurs in most industrialized societies. The disorder is often associated with high rates of comorbid psychopathology.

Compulsive buying has also been linked to eating disorders in other publications, but the data have been inconsistent (McElroy, Keck, & Phillips, 1995; Mitchell et al., 2002; Faber, Christenson, deZwaan, & Mitchell, 1995).

Compulsive Buying Scale(CBS; Faber & O’Guinn, 1989; Faber & O’Guinn, 1992), a well-validated 7-item screening instrument developed to measure compulsive buying behaviors. Lower scores on this scale indicate greater level of compulsive buying. If the score was less than or equal to\u0000 1.34, subjects were classiﬁed as compulsive buyers. Yale– Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Shopping Version(Y-BOCS-SV; Monahan, Black, & Gabel, 1996), was modeled on the Y-BOCS (Goodman et al., 1989a, b) and assesses severity and interference caused by buying thoughts and behaviors rather than of assessing obsessions and compulsions. The instrument is reliable and valid in measuring severity and change in persons with compulsive buying.

Introduction The compulsive buying disorder has been a subject of growing interest to healthcare professionals (Black, 2001), motivated largely by the increase in studies and publications in the area of compulsive behaviors (Hollander et al., 1991; Koran, 1999). Originally described by the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (Kraepelin, 1915), almost a century ago, oniomania (from Greekonios, for sale, and mania, insanity) or compulsive buying disorder remains, so far, relatively understudied.

EugenBleuler (1930)classiﬁed the compulsive buy- ing disorder as a “reactive impulse”, along with kleptomania e pyromania. In his book he mentions:“The particular element is impulsiveness; they cannot help it, which sometimes even expresses itself in the fact that the patients are absolutely incapable to think differently, and to conceive the senseless consequences of their act, and even the possibility of not doing it” (Bleuler, 1930, p. 540). Krueger (1988)and Winestine (1985)have given an account of clinical cases of oniomania from the perspective of psychoanalysis, which described the exaggerated buying behavior.

A study presented multiple cases with three patients treated with antidepressants, who achieved improvements on compulsive buying symptoms (McElroy et al., 1991) Subsequently, in 1994, a study was published with 20 participants, in which they postulate the main diagnostic criteria of this disorder and assess a suggestion of drug therapy in association with psychotherapy (McElroy et al., 1994). It has been established the criteria of the disorder and pointed out the clinical characteristics of dependence ( McElroy et al., 1994).

Compulsive buyers are more prone to episodes of lack of control with regard to buying when they experience emotions such as anger, loneliness, frustration or irritability. Thus, buying works as the key emotional regulatory factor, even though the “positive” feelings are momentary. Was presented the clinical classiﬁcation and deﬁnition for the disorder, acknowledging the cognitive and behavioral components.

Currently, compulsive buying was not included at diagnostic criteria at Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) (APA, 2013). In spite of not being classiﬁed at DSM-V (APA, 2013), there is a debate on which would be the most appropriate nosological category for the compulsive buying disorder. The association between the obsessive-compulsive and compulsive buying disorders is common. The study (McElroy et al., 1994) examines the singularities and simila- rities between the two. Thus, compulsive buying is considered a disorder of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, since it is common for both disorders to overlap and to present similar traits in their evolu- tion (Hollander et al., 1991). Other authors (Koran, 1999; Black, 2001) continued to point out impulsive character of buying, in association with impulse-control disorders, because it has biological similarities to disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania,", "num_tokens": 230, "source": "papers/1-s2.0-S0165178114004089-main.pdf", "hash": "5bfc0ebb25d869b2c2e7fc79a3f41b46"}

As far as the therapeutic proposal is concerned, there is no standard approach for treating the compulsive buying disorder. Treatment recommendations are, mostly, empirical expressions of theoretical clinical guidelines. The present study aims to system- atically review the literature on the most used therapeutic inter- ventions for the compulsive buying disorder up until this moment. 2. Methodology The bibliographic research was carried out in three international electronic databases, Web of Science (ISI), PsycInfo and Medline/Pubmed, using the following search descriptors: Compulsive Buying AND Treatment , Compulsive Buying AND Therapy, Compulsive Shopping AND treatment, Compulsive Shopping AND therapy, Pathological Buying AND treatment, Pathological", "num_tokens": 189, "source": "papers/1-s2.0-S0165178114004089-main.pdf", "hash": "69ca8dfa454f743df9d04653f1f15648"}

The author does not mention if the patient got better through therapy (Winestine, 1985). Krueger (1988)reported four clinical cases in order to establish that compulsive buying may be involved in attempts to regulate the “effect and the fragmented sense of self in order to restore the object of balance”, as well as the effort toﬁll the inner void. Only one of the four patients presented improvement of the compulsive buying symptoms.

Discussion From the literature review it was possible to identify that there is no standard approach for treating compulsive buying disorder. Recommendations for treatment are largely caused by the ther- apeutic approach and guidance, under the theoretical contribu- tion, and considerations on the level of effectiveness remain largely governed in their empirical implications.

(Am J Addict 2015;24:132–137) INTRODUCTION Compulsive buying (CB) has long been recognized as a problem, and was actually described more than 100 years ago as “oniomania” by Kraepelin.1 Much later consumer research- ers and psychiatrist became interested in the topic.

Therefore, this article aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding CB and to offer some thoughts about classiﬁcation. PHENOMENOLOGY CB is deﬁned by a preoccupation with buying and shopping, by frequent buying episodes, or overpowering urges to buy that are experienced as irresistible and senseless. 2 The shopping and buying episodes are accompanied by relief and pleasure, but followed by remorse and guilt due to the inappropriateness of the spending behavior and its negative consequences.

According to reports by patients with CB, they rarely or never use the bought items. These people are primarily interested in the process of shopping, browsing, choosing, and ordering but not in the use of the goods. For many of them, shopping is a way to manage or enhance poor sense of self and negative mood states. Many people with CB prefer to buy via internet, TV, or in anonymous malls. Others enjoy getting complements from salespersons and having“expert discussions” with them, and therefore prefer more exclusive stores. Some individuals with CB do not buy for themselves but purchase primarily presents for their relatives or friends. A sub‐group compul- sively hoard the items they have bought.

The most widely used screening instrument for CB is the Compulsive Buying Scale (CBS). 20 The CBS consists of seven items that reﬂect typical aspects of CB such as lack of impulse control, distress at the thought of others’ knowledge of the person’s spending pattern, irrational use of credit cards, tension when not shopping, and the use of shopping and buying to feel better. Faber and O’Guinn20 created a scoring system involving a regression equation with item weighting to determine the cut‐ off score (\u0000 1.34) for CB. Lower scores indicate a higher level of CB. There are several other screening instruments for CB.

ETIOLOGY Neurobiological Factors Knudson et al.29 investigated neural correlates of purchas- ing in 26 healthy consumers by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while performing purchasing decisions. Their ﬁndings demonstrated that the purchase of products was associated with an increased activity in the nucleus accumbens and the mesial prefrontal cortex. The insula was activated prior to the purchasing decision indicating that it might play an important role in the process of deciding to buy or not to buy a product.

The authors concluded that the anticipated loss of money did lead to a stronger negative emotional response in healthy controls than in the individuals with CB. Other considerations concern an imbalance in the seroto- nergic, dopaminergic, or opioid regulatory systems in individuals with CB.

However, a synthesis of the two approaches has been elusive. This might be explained by different methodologies utilized in CB research, in particular the medical and the social science perspectives. The medical perspective tends to categorize individuals as suffering or not suffering from CB disorder, and views CB not just as an extreme form of normal buying but rather as a distinct disorder. On the contrary, the social science approach tends to consider CB as being on a continuum. Although studies from consumer or psychiatry research may use either of these perspectives, it appears that the comparison between treatment‐seeking patients with CB and normal buyers indicate differences more typical for psychiatric disorders, 5 whereas the majority of consumer research has preferred the social science approach examining undergraduate students or consumers, evaluating them along a continuum of CB‐like behaviors. 38,41,42", "num_tokens": 173, "source": "papers/EBSCO-FullText-09_24_2025.pdf", "hash": "87759210062660ca6501dd85d0f1e2ce"}

The latter refers to spontaneously, immedi- ately loss ‐of‐control buying that occasionally occurs in ordinary consumers when their desire for a speciﬁc item out‐ weighs their willpower to resist it. Impulsive buying is mostly externally driven (eg, commercials, retail environmental cues). 41,42 Individuals with CB are extremely preoccupied by thoughts about shopping. Their inappropriate buying behavior is driven by internal needs and characterized by repetitive inappropriate spending patterns that interfere with social, work, or role functioning. 2,3,5 Nevertheless, external cues that trigger impulsive buying may also contribute to CB episodes.

CONSIDERATIONS ON CLASSIFICATION The importance toﬁnd a meaningful way to categorize CB is clear, given its estimated prevalence and associated burden.

The question as to how CB should best be classiﬁed remains unresolved and several considerations are currently under debate. Given the phenomenology, CB does notﬁt well into the category of obsessive ‐compulsive related disorders. The buying cognitions are not ego‐dystonic, and the CB behaviors usually not nearly as ritualized as those of patients with an obsessive‐compulsive disorder. Therefore, the term“compul- sive buying” is misleading. Given some commonalities with substance use disorders, CB could be categorized as a non ‐substance (behavioral) addiction.

As opposed to pathological gambling, which is considered a behavioral addiction in the DSM‐5, genetic and neurobiological similari- ties between CB and substance addictions have not been conﬁrmed, perhaps primarily due to the lack of research in this ﬁeld. Apart from these considerations, at least according to reports by patients we have assessed or treated, those with CB seem to experience less intense buying“rushes” compared to those with substance abuse problems.
